    <h1>Addition Tricks</h1>
    <p>Mental addition is easy to do and very helpful. Unlike paper addition, mental addition should be done from left to right. At first, this method may seem difficult for you. However, if you practice it enough, you will be able to add large numbers almost instantly. Fortunately, you will come across addition problems everywhere you go. At first, you may have trouble adding numbers larger than three digits without having them in front of you. However, with practice, you will be able to add numbers with five or more digits without even looking at them! Eventually, you should be able to add two three digit numbers in less than five seconds. <br/><br/> Practice Problems: <br/ >17+82 <br/> 354+147 <br/> 5847+6694 </p>
