    <p>Have you ever wanted to instantly figure out how much change you should receive when buying something? Have you ever tried to do a multiplication problem in your head but had to pull out your phone? If so, then you should learn some mental math tricks! This website will teach you everything from adding two numbers together to multiplying large numbers in your head! This website will teach you how to quickly do the following operations:</P>
    <ul>
      <li>Addition</li>
      <li>Subtraction</li>
      <li>Multiplication</li>
      <li>Division</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Addition</h2>
    <p>You know how you go from right to left when you add numbers on paper? Forget about that. To add numbers in your head faster and more accurately than on paper, go from left to right. This means that if you are adding three digit numbers together, you should start by adding the numbers in the hundreds place.</p>
    <h2>Subtraction</h2>
    <p>There are multiple methods to quickly subtract two numbers in your head. You can do it similarly to addition by going from left to right. You can also turn a subtraction problem into an addition problem. You can do this by taking the number you are subtracting and adding to that number until you reach the number you are subtracting from.</p>
    <h2>Multiplication and Division</h2>
    <p>Multiplying two numbers in your head is hard, but it is very impressive. There are a number of ways to do this. If you have a multiple of 5, you can add a zero to the other number and divide by 2. There are also special tricks for squaring numbers and multiplying by 11. To multiply numbers with five or more digits, you can split each number into two smaller numbers and multiply those smaller numbers with each other. Division is like subtraction in that you can turn a division problem into a multiplication problem to do it more efficiently.</p>
    <h4>Square Roots</h4>
    <p>Square roots can be approximated if you memorize your square numbers. To make more accurate approximations, you need to be able to square large numbers. The best method for square roots is guess and check, and the larger numbers you can square, the more accurate you can be.</p>
