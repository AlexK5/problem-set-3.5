    <p>Once you finish memorizing your times table, you are ready to move on to larger and more complicated problems. To start, you should practice multiplying two digit numbers. There are many methods to do this, but they all rely on the partial products method. This involves multiplying the first digit of one number by the other number, multiplying the second digit of the first number by the other number, and adding the results together. Here is how you could multiply 72 by 48:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Do 72*40=2880</li>
      <li>Do 72*8=576</li>
      <li>Add 2880 and 576</li>
      <li>The answer is 3456</li>
    </ol>
    <p>However, that involves doing some tough problems. Here is an easier way:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Do 72*50 as 72*100/2=3600</li>
      <li>Do 72*2=144</li>
      <li>Subtract 144 from 3600</li>
      <li>The answer is 3456.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Two digit multiplication can be difficult at first. A good way to improve it is by multiplying a two digit number by a one digit number because most methods of two digit multiplication can be simplified into two of those problems. With practice, you should be able to multiply two digit numbers in your head in under ten seconds. Three digit multiplication can be done using similar methods to two digit multiplication except that it is harder and takes longer. You should eventually be able to do it in under a minute. Here are some practice two and three digit multiplication problems: <br/><br/>91*62<br/>73*87<br/>489*723</p>
    <p>Multiplication problems with four or more digits take a <span class="very">very</span> long time, so do not mess them up. You will probably have to say numbers out loud to memorize them and will need to hold over twenty digits in your head at once. Before doing these problems, you should practice ways to improve your short term memory. You can do this by chunking, or grouping segments of three or four digits together. You can do four digit problems similarly to three digit problems, but you will need to use new methods once you get to five digits. <br/>For five digit or more multiplication problems, you should <strike class:"impact">just use a calculator</strike> split each number into two. Here is how to do 684294*539137:
    <ol>
      <li>Split 684294 into 684 and 294</li>
      <li>Split 539137 into 539 and 137</li>
      <li>Multiply 684*539=368676 and<span class="add"> add </span>six zeros to this answer because you are technically multiplying 684000 and 539000</li>
      <li>Multiply 294*137=40278 and<span class="add"> add </span>no zeros</li>
      <li>Multiply 684*137=93708 and<span class="add"> add </span>three zeros</li>
      <li>Multiply 539*294=158466 and<span class="add"> add </span>three zeros</li>
      <li>The answer is <span class="bigNumber">368928214278</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p>You should only do problems of this length when you have few distractions and a lot of time. Multiplying 4 digit numbers should take you less than ten minutes with practice. For problems with five or more digits, you may need to take over an hour. The more time you take, the more likely you are to get the answer right, so you should take your time.</p>
    <p>Division is the opposite of multiplication. You can do division with an algorithm similar to the count up method. Here are the steps to do a division problem:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Figure out the number of times the smaller number goes into the larger number and make that the next digit of your answer</li>
      <li>Subtract the larger number from the product of the number you obtained in the previous step and the smaller the smaller number</li>
      <li>Add a zero</li>
      <li>Repeat these steps however many times you want</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here is how to do 463/79 using this method:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>79 goes into 463 5 times</li>
      <li>Do 463-(79*5)=68</li>
      <li>Add a zero to get 680</li>
      <li>79 goes into 680 8 times</li>
      <li>Do 680-(79*8)=48</li>
      <li>Add a zero to get 480</li>
      <li>Continue with 480/79</li>
      <li>So far, you answer would be 5.8</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Dividing large numbers is not as difficult as multiplying them because you will only need to multiply each number by a single digit when dividing. With practice, you should be able to divide a three digit number by a two digit number in below ten seconds per significant figure in your answer. Here are some practice problems: <br/><br/>67/7<br/>385/91<br/>926/46</p>
    <p>Square roots are <span class="very">very</span> similar to division. However, you have to square large numbers when doing square roots, so it is <span class="very">very</span> difficult. Here is how you would calculate the square root of 19:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>The highest number you can square to get a number below 19 is 4</li>
      <li>Add two zeros to 19 to get 1900</li>
      <li>The highest number you can square to get a number below 1900 is 43</li>
      <li>Add two zeros to 1900 to get 190000</li>
      <li>Figure out the highest number you can square to get a number below 190000</li>
      <li>So far, your answer would be 4.3</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Unlike division, square roots get exponentially harder when dealing with more numbers. However, a shortcut to finding the highest number whose square is below the number you are square rooting is to foil (x+1)^2 and get x^2+2x+1. This is useful because to get (40+1)^2, you can just ad 2(40)+1=81 to 40^2, which is 1600. You will eventually be able to square root a number with 2 significant figures in under 30 seconds.</p>
